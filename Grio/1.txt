Write a program that prints out a list of 5 digit prime-numbers that can be found in a given table. Let's called this program FindPrime.
It takes in string of numbers as the table. For simplicity, let's assume that the table size is always 5x5. This is an example of how you run FindPrime:

FindPrime 5203830594313459791285023
	
In this case, the table is:

5 2 0 3 8 
3 0 5 9 4 
3 1 3 4 5 
9 7 9 1 2 
8 5 0 2 3

FindPrime will find ALL possible 5 digit prime numbers that can be constructed from the numbers of sequentially adjacent numbers, where "adjacent" numbers are those horizontally, vertically, and diagonally neighboring.
One of the prime number from the above table is 17921 and here's how FindPrime found it:
- 1 is from col 2, row 3
- 7 is vertically adjacent to 1 (down)
- 9 is horizontally adjacent to 7 (right)
- 2 is diagonally adjacent to 9 (down right)
- 1 is vertically adjacent to 2 (up)

You can write this program in any programming language of your choice. If there's any ambiguities, feel free to assume and make sure you state your assumptions.

Have fun!
